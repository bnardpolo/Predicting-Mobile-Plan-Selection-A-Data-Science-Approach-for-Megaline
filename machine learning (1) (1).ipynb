    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Predicting Mobile Plan Selection\" project focuses on developing a data science model to analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend appropriate plans for a mobile carrier, Megaline. Many of Megaline's subscribers currently use legacy plans, and the company aims to leverage machine learning techniques to encourage their transition to newer plans such as Smart or Ultra.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project utilizes behavior data obtained from subscribers who have already switched to the new plans, providing valuable insights for the classification task. By building an accurate model, Megaline can effectively predict the suitable plan for each subscriber based on their call frequency, call duration, text message usage, and internet traffic. This personalized approach enables Megaline to optimize its plan recommendations, enhance customer satisfaction, and potentially increase revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data preprocessing step has been completed, allowing us to focus directly on creating the model. Through the use of Python and various machine learning libraries, we will split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Additionally, we will investigate the performance of different models by adjusting hyperparameters, aiming for the highest possible accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's ultimate goal is to achieve a model accuracy of at least 0.75, as specified by the threshold. This accuracy threshold ensures that the model can reliably recommend the appropriate plan to Megaline subscribers. Furthermore, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the model's performance using the test dataset to verify its generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to meeting the project objectives, we will perform a sanity check on the model. This step involves a closer examination of the model's predictions, comparing them to the actual data, and assessing any potential areas of improvement or limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By successfully developing and evaluating the model, we aim to provide Megaline with a robust tool for analyzing subscriber behavior, predicting plan selection, and driving effective decision-making in plan recommendations."

    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Predicting Mobile Plan Selection\" project aimed to develop a data science model to analyze subscriber behavior and recommend appropriate plans for Megaline, a mobile carrier. By leveraging machine learning techniques and utilizing behavior data from subscribers who have already switched plans, the project sought to improve plan recommendations and increase customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, we conducted data preprocessing and split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. We explored different models and adjusted hyperparameters to achieve the highest possible accuracy. The model's performance was evaluated using validation and test datasets, with an accuracy threshold of 0.75 set as the project requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The developed model demonstrated strong performance, surpassing the desired accuracy threshold. The validation accuracy of 0.7947 and test accuracy of 0.8087 indicated that the model effectively predicted the appropriate plan for subscribers based on their behavior. These results confirmed the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data and provided confidence in its effectiveness for plan recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a sanity check was performed to validate the model's predictions. The analysis of correct and incorrect predictions shed light on specific areas where the model may require further improvement or fine-tuning. By addressing these areas, the model can continue to evolve and enhance its accuracy over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the \"Predicting Mobile Plan Selection\" project offers Megaline a powerful tool for analyzing subscriber behavior and making personalized plan recommendations. By integrating the model into their systems, Megaline can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize plan adoption, and potentially increase revenue. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the model's performance will ensure its effectiveness as subscriber behaviors and preferences evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this project showcases the value of data science and machine learning in providing data-driven insights and driving informed decision-making in the telecommunications industry. With the developed model, Megaline is well-positioned to leverage subscriber behavior data and improve the overall customer experience."
